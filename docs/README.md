<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About HydroBuddy

[![Project Demo Screen Shot][demo-screenshot]](https://github.com/dineshUmasankar/HydroBuddy/)

As a college student, most of my time is spent near my desk on schoolwork resulting in my sedentary lifestyle. Unfortunately, this has caused me to neglect health priorities such as at least drinking a minimum of 8 cups of water a day. Luckily, I tend to have discord (social media platform) open in the background in case of friends requesting my help.

By adding this bot to your server or finding it on another server, you and your friends can also receive personalized water drinking reminders.
